## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

In this project, I have tried to classify the fraud transactions using diffrent machine learning algorithms. As dataset is highly unbalanced so I have used sampling methods to balance the dataset. Used Random Forest, Decision Tree and ANN for training. Achieved accurracy of 99.4% after applying SMOTE on ANN.
